schoolOfAI_EVA8
The repository would contain various assignments and tasks done as part of EVA8 course at the school of AI.

At EVA 2.5 assignment, we would be given an image from MNIST handwritten digits grayscale image set and a random number. 
We would have to predict the summation of the two numbers.
We have built two input neural network that takes an image and a random number generated between 0 and 9.
We have used gpu accelerated training to quickly train the model and provide results.

Initially I have considered two input one output case, but later I re-checked and found, two outputs are to be required.
Hence uploaded a new file with two output case, and in additional, we are printing loss in every 20 epochs.
